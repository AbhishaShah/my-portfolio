                <p><strong>Bug tracking and managing system </strong></p>
                <p>
                   This software is mainly connection between QA Testers and Developers as well as designers.
                  <p>Before development of this project, Developer just gives the project details in mail and explained it. Then after QA team writes the bugs in Excel sheet. Every time that sheet give it to developers and then developers check and correct the bug and again give modified project to QA team.
                   But is like manual and very time consuming and no such a particular Flow was followed.</p>
                  Features:
                  After Development of particular project fetuare then Project manager create the QA tasks as per modules in online system. In that all project urls, documentations, exception criteria included in that and assigned to the QA members.
                  So automatically QA members get the ideas what they need to check and what not. Besides of that there is a QA bug link. By clicking on that QA bug sheet open in tabular format.
                  In that diff filed like QA bug details, which king of bug like designing base or functional, browser compatibility or Syntax based with diff status like open, completed, in review like that.
                  And simultaneously this sheet can also be viewed by developer. So at the same time developer can see the bug and solve it in another version of project and can change the status like completed or ignored as exceptions.
                  This is just basic idea of project, it has so many functionalities. But at the end it is easy to use and review process, can minimise the bugs and get overall idea of QA Process and timings for Project manager, developers and whole team.
